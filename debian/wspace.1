.SH NAME
wspace \- whitespace-only programming language
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B whitespace
.RI ["filename"]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B whitespace
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution

.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBwhitespace\fP is a small programming language written to address the
shortage of significant whitespace in mainstream languages.
.SH FURTHER INFORMATION
The canonical documentation for \fBwhitespace\fP can be found at
