Description: Programming language where only whitespace counts
 Most modern programming languages do not consider white space characters
 (spaces, tabs and newlines) syntax, ignoring them, as if they weren't there.
 Whitespace is a language that seeks to redress the balance. Any non whitespace
 characters are ignored; only spaces, tabs and newlines are considered syntax.
